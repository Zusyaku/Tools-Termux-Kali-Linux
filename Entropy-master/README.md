Its just a prototype of a WAF core which makes of mathematical algorithms to determine if the input is malicious.<br>
Play with it by entering payloads (prefer XSS for now) and let me know about your experience.

#### Detection Methods
- Entropy
- Shannon Entropy
- Levenshtein Distance
- Special Character Ratio
- Some regex (I don't think its necessary but still...)

### How it works?
**Entropy** gets it name from a scientific term "Entropy".
> Entropy is basically the measure of randomness of something

But how does it apply to detection of malicious payloads?</br>
Take a look at these two strings and their entropy
```
String: black pens & red caps
Entropy: 0.000302964443769

String: <svg onload=alert()>
Entropy: 53.4044125463
```
Does it make sense now?<br>
Let me introduce you to all the algorithms used now

##### Entropy
Here's how we calculate entropy:
```
log(score)/log(2)) * len(payload)
```
Where score is the number of special characters in the string.<br>
Higher the entropy, higher is the probablity of string to be malicious.

##### Shannon Entropy
```
for number in range(256):
    result = float(payload.count(chr(number)))/len(payload)
    if result != 0:
        entropy = entropy - result * log(result, 2)
```
For a better understanding take a look the source code.<br>
But what shannon entropies does is that considers patterns unlike the normal entropy.<br>
Take a look at these three strings and their shannon entropies:
```
String: s0md3v
Entropy: 2.58496250072

String: ../../../../
Entropy: 0.918295834054

String: //////////////
Entropy: 0.0
```
The first string has no repeating pattern and hence has the highest value of shannon entropy while the second string however has a repeating pattern which lowers it entropy to nearly one. The last string only consists a single character and has no randomness and hence has 0 shannon entropy.<br>
So again, higher the shannon entropy, higher is the probablity of string to be malicious.

##### Special Char ratio
```
(len(payload) - score) <= len(payload)/2
```
Where score is again the number of special characters in the string.<br>
We are just checking if the string's 50% part or more is made of special characters.<br>
Higher is the special char ration, higher is the probablity of string to be malicious.

##### Levenshtein Distance
Most of the WAFs check if the input matches a regex or payload in their signature database. But instead of looking for same payloads in signature database, <b>Entropy</b> looks for *similar* payloads using Levenshtein Distance algorithm.
Instead of reinventing the wheel and writing the algorithm myself, I used <b>FuzzyWuzzy</b> module but when this project will be further developed, I may use my own code.

Thats all folks.
