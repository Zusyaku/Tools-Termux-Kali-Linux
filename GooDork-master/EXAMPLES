Here are some examples to help you get started
Descriptions of the dorks are demarkated by #, do not inlcude these parts in the GooDork arguments

Example: (domain restrictions)
site:.gov																					  #Returns sites under the .gov domain
General Application:
	site:[domain]
Example: (Text wise restrictions + URL restriction)

	intext:You%20Have%20an%20Error -u\\.\php\(\\?\|%3F\)[\\w]\(%3D\|=\)[\\d]  #Finds php scripts displaying a MySQL error
		General Application:
			intext:[arg] -u [Domain|Scriptname] \\.php\(\\?|%3F\) [keyword] \(%3D\|=\) [argument]
Example: (Text wise restriction + URL restriction)

	intext:%22Website%20By%20Andensal.dk%22 -u\\.\php\(\\?\|%3F\)id\(%3D\|=\) #SQLi vulns from http://1337day.com/exploits/17900
						^															  ^

Let me know if you wanna find something, I'm busy extending this project so you guys can autonomously search for the vulns
reported on 1337day.com
Also sorting out a logger so you can save your favourite dorks using GooDork as a dork repo ;)

Cheers hope this helped!
