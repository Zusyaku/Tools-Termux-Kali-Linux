GooDork 2.2 : Command line google dorking tool
------------------------------------------
GooDork is a simple python script designed to allow you to leverage the
power of google dorking straight from the comfort of your command line.

GooDork offers powerfull use of googles search directives, by analyzing results
from searches using regular expressions that you supply.

So basically the purpose of GooDork is to combined Dorking with Regular expressions

GooDork allows you to apply regular expressions to any and all of the follow attributes of web applications
	*URL
	*displayable Text
	*anchors
Many more options will shortly be made available

Another thing I must say is that I'm using python regexes, so please read up on that, though
staight forward text matching works just fine ;)

GooDork 2.2 now allows the use of custom User-Agents with the '-U' switch.

*** check out the 'NEW_FEATURES' file to see what I've added and improved in this version
