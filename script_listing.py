# Modifications		: 1.1 - 28-02-2012 - CR - Added the variable to get the logs directory, I then joined the output so the file goes to the logs directory
#							: 1.2 - 29-05/2012 - CR - Changed the line so it doesn't ask for a directory, it now uses the environment varaible scripts

# Description			: This will list all the files in the given directory, it will also go through all the subdirectories as well

import os  # Load the library module

logdir = os.getenv("logs")  # Set the variable logdir by getting the value from the OS environment variable logs
logfile = 'script_list.log'  # Set the variable logfile
path = os.getenv("scripts")  # Set the varable path by getting the value from the OS environment variable scripts - 1.2

# path = (raw_input("Enter dir: "))										  # Ask the user for the directory to scan
logfilename = os.path.join(logdir, logfile)  # Set the variable logfilename by joining logdir and logfile together
log = open(logfilename, 'w')  # Set the variable log and open the logfile for writing

for dirpath, dirname, filenames in os.walk(path):  # Go through the directories and the subdirectories
    for filename in filenames:  # Get all the filenames
        log.write(os.path.join(dirpath, filename) + '\n')  # Write the full path out to the logfile

print("\nYour logfile ", logfilename, "has been created")  # Small message informing the user the file has been created
