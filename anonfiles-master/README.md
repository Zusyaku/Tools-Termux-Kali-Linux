# NOTES

 NOTE: It is Only For Educational Purposes. Neither I Say Nor I Promote To Do Anything Illegal.

<b>Remember Not To Encrypt Files Above 512 KB</b>
   As All The Encryption Has Been Done With pyaes which is A Pure-Python Implementation and has no dependencies.

  In Future Project Will Use pycrypto which will increase encryption speed to a great extent but will have dependencies.

Suggest Me A Feature For The Future Update And I Will Add It
