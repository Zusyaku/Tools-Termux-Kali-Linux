Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers
such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,
and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

def twoSum(nums, target):
    chk_map = {}
    for index, val in enumerate(nums):
        compl = target - val
        if compl in chk_map:
            indices = [chk_map[compl], index]
            print(indices)
            return [indices]
        else:
            chk_map[val] = index
    return False
