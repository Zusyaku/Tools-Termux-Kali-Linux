# Android 
This module uses the Metasploit framework built into Kali Linux to create and Android apk that will allow a back door into the users phone. 
# Windows
Metasploit can be used to make simple yet powerful backdoor for windows that can allow a hacker complete access and control over the target system.
# Linux
Metasploit can be used to make simple yet powerful backdoor for Linux that can allow a hacker complete access and control over the target system.
# PHP
Reverse shell is a kind of “virtual” shell that is initiated  from a victim’s computer to connect with attacker’s computer. Once the connection is established, it allows attacker to send over commands to execute on the victim’s computer and to get results back. The attacker can execute any command/program on the victim’s computer at the same privilege as the current login user who initiated the connection. 
# FTP/SSH bruteforce
In a brute-force attack, the hacker uses all possible combinations of letters, numbers, special characters, and small and capital letters in an automated way to gain access over a host or a service. This type of attack has a high probability of success, but it requires an enormous amount of time to process all the combinations.
# WordPress
On WordPress versions 5.0.0 and <= 4.9.8 it is possible to gain arbitrary code execution via a core vulnerability combining a Path Traversal and a Local File Inclusion. An attacker who gains access to an account with at least author privileges on the target can execute PHP code on the remote server.
# FTP Backdoor
VSFTPD v4.3.4 contains a backdoor that is triggered by entering anystring:) as the username (no password required). After the backdoor is triggered, the target machine opens a shell on port 6200.
# IP Cameras
How to find vulnerable webcams with the help of Shodan and Metasploit framework.
