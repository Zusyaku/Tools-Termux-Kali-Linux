Telethon
========

**Telethon** is an `asyncio
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_ **Python 3** library
to interact with Telegram's API.

**If you're upgrading from Telethon pre-1.0 to 1.0, please make sure to read**
`this section of the documentation
<https://telethon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extra/basic/asyncio-magic.html>`_,
or ``pip install telethon-sync`` which is compatible with `synchronous code
<https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/tree/sync>`_. Don't forget to remove
the asynchronous version (``pip uninstall telethon``) if you do install sync.
