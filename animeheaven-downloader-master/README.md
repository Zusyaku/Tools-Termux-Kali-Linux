> **README:** this is not official, and dev for this script is nothing related with Anime Heaven team. It was written by myself  just to download anime episodes easily. Anime episodes credit go to [Anime Heaven](http://animeheaven.eu/).  

- If you want on-schedule automated downloader with episode sync, go check "[Anime On Schedule Downloader](https://github.com/the-robot/anime-onschedule-downloader)"

**Changes**
- codebase is refactored
- add logger methods, modularized the code so it can be reused in other automated scripts (see [WHY](https://github.com/the-robot/animeheaven-downloader/blob/master/README.md#why-the-heck-did-he-refactor-the-code) at the bottom)
- add animeheaven request blocked handling
- remove the use of progressbar2, and use custom simple progressbar
