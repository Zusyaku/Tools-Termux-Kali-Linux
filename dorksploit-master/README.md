# dorksploit
Advance Google Dorker and Vulnerability Scanner

# Introduction

DorkSploit is a Tool which finds the list of website according to your given GOOGLE dork. This can be used for Finding SQLi , XSS , LFI/RFI Vulnerable Websites.

Each page of generated dorks contains about 10 Websites. So if you type 1 page it gives 10 websites , 2 page gives 20 websites, etc.

Website Vulnerablity Scanner Scans only For SQLi Vulnerablity. It will Soon Be Updated To Scan For Other Vulnerabilities. Keep Supporting ME ;-)"
