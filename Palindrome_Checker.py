# PALINDROME: A word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward

#if nothing in given as input then the sample phrase is stored in the variable phrase otherwise the given phrase if stored
if givenPhrase == "":
    print("\nThe sample phrase is: {0}".format(samplePhrase))
    phrase = samplePhrase

# check using two pointers, one at beginning
# other at the end. Use only half of the list.

Method #2:

A simple mmethod is , to reverse the string and and compare with original string.
If both are same that's means string is pelindrome otherwise else.

if phrase==phrase[::-1]:#slicing technique
    """phrase[::-1] this code is for reverse a string very smartly """
