# Locky
Locky generates "really" strong yet easy to remember passwords.

Passwords generated by Locky have following features:
- 20+ chars
- Really high entropy
- Easy to remember
- Padding between words
- Custom element (name)
Hence the passwords can't be bruteforced, can't be guessed* and can't be forgotten.

### Compatibility
Locky is compatible with python2 as well as python three.
Libraries used in Locky are as follows:
- random
- sys
- math
Locky uses escape sequences to generate colored text which won't work in winodws. So, Locky will run on windows but won't look good.
