==How to use Astra==[simple guide]

for issues, visit our Telegram group- telegram.me/Techmedies_Hub

first you need to store accounts for scraping and adding purposes in manager.py
So launch in terminal

> python manager.py

--To add new accounts, choose 1
Then enter number of accounts you wanna add
Then enter your phone numbers
After that, you have to login from the newly added accounts
Enter login code and 2FA password[if u have set] and proceed

--To filter out all the banned accounts, choose option2

--To delete specific accounts, choose option3
Choose any account to delete and proceed

Now we need to add members to a group

So launch in terminal

> python add.py

Enter group link you wanna scrape users from
It can be a private link or a public link

General format of public grp link

https://t.me/username

General format of private group link

https://t.me/joinchat/hash

***** Note *****

If you have scraped from a group before, Astra remembers it and it'll ask you whether to scrape 
from the same group or not. Enter y for yes and n for no and proceed
****************

Then enter number of accounts you wanna use

=Each account will attempt to add 60 members=

Then choose whether to add to public group or to a private group

Then enter group link and proceed

Then you need to enter delay time per request

What is it?

It is the amount of time Astra will wait before adding the next user

Output is
*********
Adds a guy to a group
--------
Waits for some seconds
--------
Adds another guy to the same group


==If you want rapid adding, then you can set the delay time to 0 It means Astra won't wait while adding users
But chances of getting peer flood error from Telegram is more==


Recommended delays are

5 secs, 10secs, 15secs, 20secs or 60 secs if u want, but it is damn slow XD

Then, sit back and watch Astra adding members
